## 1. Deploying to Netlify

Your site has been deployed to Netlify by Pixel Perfect Designs and is ready to be transferred to you.

**Step 1 — Create a Netlify account**
- Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up (free)
- Use your email address or sign up with Google

**Step 2 — Accept the transfer**
- Once your account is created, notify Pixel Perfect Designs
- They will initiate a site transfer from their Netlify account to yours
- You'll receive an email from Netlify — click **"Accept transfer"**
- The site and all deploy history will move to your account

**That's it.** Your site will continue to work exactly as before, now under your ownership.

> **After the transfer:** Open `index.html` and find the two `og:image` meta tags near the top. Update the relative path `brand_assets/social_preview.jpg` to your full domain URL, e.g. `https://joewillysseafoodhouse.com/brand_assets/social_preview.jpg`. Send the updated file to Pixel Perfect Designs to push the change, or push it yourself if you have GitHub access.

## 2. Connecting a Custom Domain

**Step 1 — Add your domain in Netlify**
- In your site dashboard go to **Domain management → Add a domain**
- Enter your domain (e.g. `joewillysseafoodhouse.com`) and click **Verify**

**Step 2 — Update your DNS**
- Log into your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
- Add or update the following DNS records:

| Type | Name | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| `A` | `@` | `75.2.60.5` |
| `CNAME` | `www` | `your-site-name.netlify.app` |

- DNS changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate

**Step 3 — Enable HTTPS**
- Once the domain is connected, go to **Domain management → HTTPS**
- Click **"Verify DNS configuration"** then **"Provision certificate"**
- Netlify handles the SSL certificate automatically at no cost

## 3. Making Content Updates

All content lives in the single file `index.html`. To make changes:

1. Open `index.html` in any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)
2. Use **Ctrl+F** (Find) to search for the text you want to change
3. Make your edit, save the file
4. Commit and push to GitHub — Netlify will redeploy automatically within 60 seconds

### Common Updates

**Hours**
Search for `Tue–Sat` — you'll find two instances, one in the info bar and one in the footer. Update both.

**Phone number**
Search for `765-0234` — update all instances.

**Specials / Promotions**
Search for `Happy Hour`, `Wine Wednesdays`, or `Kids Eat` to find those cards and edit the day, time, or description.

**Menu item names or prices**
Search for the dish name (e.g. `Lobster Roll`) to find its card and edit the name, price, or description.

**About section text**
Search for `opened our doors in 2008` to find the about section paragraphs.

**Email or social links**
Search for `joewillysrestaurant@yahoo.com` or `joewillysseafood` to find and update those links.

## 4. Swapping Images

All images are stored in the `brand_assets/` folder.

To replace an image:
1. Name your new image **exactly the same** as the one you're replacing (same filename, same extension)
2. Drop it into the `brand_assets/` folder, overwriting the old file
3. Commit and push — the site will update automatically

| Image File | Used For |
|---|---|
| `joe_willys_hero.png` | Desktop hero background |
| `mobile_hero_2.png` | Mobile hero background |
| `joe_willys_square_logo.png` | Logo in nav and footer |
| `owners.jpg` | Photo in the About section |
| `bar.jpg` | Gallery — first/tall image |
| `diningroom.jpg` | Gallery |
| `privatedining.jpg` | Gallery |
| `boothtable.jpg` | Gallery |
| `in_the_kitchen.png` | Gallery |
| `joe_willys_menu.pdf` | Linked from "See Full Menu" and "Full Menu PDF" buttons |

> **To update the menu PDF:** Replace `joe_willys_menu.pdf` in `brand_assets/` with your new file using the exact same filename.

## 5. Updating the Social Preview Image

The social preview (`brand_assets/social_preview.jpg`) is what appears when someone shares your website link on Facebook, Instagram, iMessage, etc.

To regenerate it after making changes:
- Contact Pixel Perfect Designs — the image is generated programmatically and requires the development tools to recreate

To use a custom image instead:
1. Create an image at exactly **1200 × 630 pixels**
2. Save it as `social_preview.jpg`
3. Drop it into `brand_assets/`, overwriting the existing file
4. Commit and push
